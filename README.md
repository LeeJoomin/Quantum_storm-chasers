## Project Description 

In the following project we apply various Quantum algorithms to weather related image data. Our business proposal is also aligned with developing a quantum weathert application. We have also partially implemented a quantum SVM in Pennylane, but it still needs some work.

## Setup
Example:
1. Make sure you have X installed and configured.

2. Set up your preferred virtual environment.

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Use
Example:
From command line: Use python solvers/script.py -h

After you have activate your environment, before you install anything, make sure
to update your pip with: pip install --upgrade pip
